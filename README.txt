TO DOs for now:
Figure out how we can get list of all available stops.
Prepare parser for responses which translates them into POJO.
Prepare interface to put POJO into database (ms sql / mysql).
We need to do it periodically - do we have machine running 24/7 or want to do it from PUT or some cloud?

BTW 
I suggest writing in C# or Java since all of us had it on studies presumably - agreed?
Just so you know I am using Fiddler as http listener (great) and build-in chrome dev tools.
